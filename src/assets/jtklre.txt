CHAPTER 3:
- The Eye of the Needle
-- You need more space. A narrow cave is no place to fight, and it's no place to stay forever.
-- For those who dwell in caves, meaning lies beyond the shadows dancing on the walls.

- The Fury
-- Angels and Demons are cut from the same cloth, and it's best not to deny a proud being.
-- An angel felled is a demon scorned.

-- Redemption in the thicket of distrust.

- The Cage
-- When you've seen the worst sights the prison of the world can offer, you can always choose to walk away empty-handed.
-- A vicious cycle framed in chain.

- The Grey
-- There are many reasons spirits may linger. The flames of passion. The flood of words left unspoken.
-- Feelings buried like knives in hearts.

- Happy Ever After
-- You don't need the world for your happy ending.
-- Everything you didn't know you wanted.
